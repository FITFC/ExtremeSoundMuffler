# ExtremeSoundMuffler
## Client side sound Muffler

Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively.

**This Mod needs FORGE to work.**

### HOW IT WORKS:

**1-** Click on the button in your inventory or asign a key to open the gui.

**2-** Click on the button next to the sound you want to muffle.

**3-** Enjoy peace.

**Some objects (like minecarts) make a constant sound, they need to be replaced after you muffle the sound.**

You can toggle the muffled sound on/off with the **toggle muffle button**
You can search sounds; click on the **search button** to open the **search bar** and type the name of the sound you want.
You can configure **anchors*** (10 max) to muffle sounds in a 16 blocks radious.
You can rename **anchors**

The list of muffled sounds are store in the profile folder, so you don't need to re-muffle the sounds on every world.
Anchors are saves in saves/(client world name)/ESM or saves/ESM/ServerWorld if you're playing on a server.
